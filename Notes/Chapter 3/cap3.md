# Why might any language want to be object oriented?
Basically in author's perspective if you use OOP you evit naming conflicts because each class has its own implementation of each code, for example:

imagine you have a method called "copy", so your "child" methods will be

vector-copy, array-copy, object-copy, etc

Of course each one of this would have its own implementation. In OOP this will be coverage by class, while in languages like C this would be coverage inside the header file (or .c file)

# Classes or prototypes?
Classes are simpler (in author's perspective), prototype is just largely use because of Javascript
